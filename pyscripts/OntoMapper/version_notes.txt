OntoMapper_20150427	(ant1b contrib)


More completely generalised queries.
	Ontology queries processed according to parameters stored in a separate file (onto_and_props.csv).
	Previously: ontology name, sparql endpoint url, mandatory annotations to query, optional annotations to query.
	Additional parameters: sparql query prefixes, sparql query uri.
	Bypasses format_SPARQL_Query() function.
	Entry template for csvdict constituted based on thus specified optional annotations, extracts by preliminary round of queries (since OntoMapper_20150424), only label and id corresponding in each ontology to each annotation sought instead of full batch of optional annotations (new).
	Queries constituted by UNION of prefixed and un-prefixed optional annotations.
	Superficial testing performed: 3 terms-list, individual ontos and cross-ontos.
	Not systematically compared script outcome to expected manually resolved outcome.
