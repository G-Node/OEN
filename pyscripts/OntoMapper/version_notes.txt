Early generalised script.
	Ontology queries processed in batch according to parameters stored in a separate file,
	specifying which ontology to query from, which endpoint to use for each one, and what property to

	Requires testing, refining, and full generalising.
	Tag "provenance", read from file, made availabel for each term to track term list construction.
