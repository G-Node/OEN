;;amplifier_pass_band;http://purl.bioontology.org/NEMO/ontology/NEMO.owl#NEMO_2237000;amplifier_pass_band is a band of frequencies, between specified limits, that a circuit (e.g., an amplifier or filter) is capable of handling.  All frequencies below the lower limit and above the upper limit are not allowed to pass.  The limiting frequencies are defined as those at which the relative intensity or power decreases to a specified fraction of the maximum intensity or power.  This decrease in power is often specified to be the half-power points (i.e., 3 dB below the maximum power).

resistance;NEMO_related;electrical_resistance;http://purl.bioontology.org/NEMO/ontology/NEMO.owl#NEMO_4603000;Electrical resistance is the disposition of a material to oppose to an electric current when a potential difference (i.e., a voltage) is applied.    Resistance (R) is equal to the voltage applied across the resistor (V) over the electric current through the resistor (I).
;neurolex_related;Resource:Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database;http://neurolex.org/wiki/Nif-2D0000-2D21195;"The Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database is a curated public database designed to represent, store, and analyze the different forms of data underlying HIVs drug resistance. HIVDB 
has three main types of content: (1) Database queries and references, (2) Interactive programs, and (3) Educational resources. 
Database queries are designed primarily for researchers studying HIV drug resistance. The interactive programs and educational resources are designed for both researchers and those wishing to learn more about HIV drug resistance. 
1.DATABASE QUERY AND REFERENCE PAGES 
Genotype-Treatment Correlations 
This Genotype-Treatment section of the database links to 15 interactive query pages that explore the relationship between treatment with HIV-1 antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) and mutations in HIV reverse transcriptase (RT), protease, and integrase. There are five types of interactive query pages: 
 Treatment Profiles (Protease and RT inhibitors) 
 Mutation Profiles (Protease and RT mutations) 
 Detailed Treatment Queries (Protease, RT, and integrase inhibitors) 
 Detailed Mutation Queries (Protease, RT, and integrase mutations) 
 Mutation Prevalence According to Subtype and Treatment 
Genotype-Phenotype Correlations 
The main page of the Genotype-Phenotype Correlations section links to four interactive query pages: three dynamically updated data summaries and one regularly updated downloadable dataset.

2. INTERACTIVE PROGRAMS 
HIVDB has seven main interactive programs. 
1. HIVdb Program 
 Mutation List Analysis 
 Sequence Analysis 
 HIVdb Output 
 Sierra Web Service 
 Release Notes 
 Algorithm Specification Interface (ASI) 
2. HIValg Program 
3. HIVseq Program 
4. Calibrated Population Resistance (CPR) tool 
5. Mutation ARV Evidence Listing (MARVEL) 
6. ART-AiDE 
7. Rega HIV-1 Subtyping tool 
Three programs in the HIV Drug Resistance Database share a common code base: HIVseq, HIVdb, and HIValg. HIVseq accepts user-submitted protease, RT, and integrase sequences, compares them to the consensus subtype B reference sequence, and uses the differences as query parameters for interrogating the HIV Drug Resistance database (Shafer, D Jung, & B Betts, Nat Med 2000; Rhee SY et al. AIDS 2006). The query result provides users with the prevalence of protease, RT and integrase mutations according to subtype and PI, nucleoside RT inhibitor (NRTI), non-nucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), and integrase inhibitor (INI) exposure. This allows users to detect unusual sequence results immediately so that the person doing the sequencing can check the primary sequence output while it is still on the desktop. In addition, unexpected associations between sequences or isolates can be discovered by immediately retrieving data on isolates sharing one or more mutations with the sequence. 
There are three ways in which the HIVdb program can be used: (i) entering a list of protease and RT mutations, (ii) entering a complete sequence containing protease, RT, and/or integrase, and (iii) using a Web Service. 
HIVdb is an expert system that accepts user-submitted HIV-1 pol sequences and returns inferred levels of resistance to 20 FDA-approved ARV drugs including 8 PIs, 7 NRTIs, 4 NNRTIs, and - with this update - one INI. In the HIVdb system, each HIV-1 drug resistance mutation is assigned a drug penalty score and a comment; the total score for a drug is derived by adding the scores of each mutation associated with resistance to that drug. Using the total drug score, the program reports one of the following levels of inferred drug resistance: susceptible, potential low-level resistance, low-level resistance, intermediate resistance, and high-level resistance. 
HIValg is designed for users interested in comparing the results of different algorithms or who are interested in comparing and evaluating existing and newly developed algorithms. The ability to develop new algorithms that can be run on the HIV Drug Resistance Database depends on the Algorithm Specific Interface (ASI) compiler (Shafer & Betts JCM 2003). 
Submission of Sequences and Mutations 
For each of the three programs, sequences can be entered using either the Sequence Analysis Form or the Mutation List form. 
3. EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES

The Duke Image Analysis Laboratory (DIAL) is committed to providing comprehensive imaging support in research studies and clinical trials to various agencies. The capabilities of the lab include protocol development, site training and certification, and image archival and analysis for a variety of modalities including magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, computed tomography and nuclear medicine. 
DIAL uses the latest technologies to analyze Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data sets of the brain. Currently the lab is engaged in measurement of the hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, ventricular system, and other brain regional volumes. Each of these techniques have undergone a rigorous validation process. The measurements of brain structures provide a useful means of non-invasively testing for changes in the brain of the patient. Changes over time in the brain can be detected, and evaluated with respect to the treatment that the patient is receiving. 
Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) allows DIAL to obtain an accurate profile of the chemical content of the brain. This sensitive technique can detect small changes in the metabolic state of the brain; changes that vary in response to administration of therapeutic agents. The ability to detect these subtle shifts in brain chemistry allows DIAL to identify changes in the brain with more sensitivity than allowed by image analysis. In this respect, NMR spectroscopy can provide early detection of changes in the brain, and serves to compliment the data obtained from image analysis. 
Additionally, DIAL also contains SQUID (Scalable Query Utility and Image Database).

DIAL uses the latest technologies to analyze Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data sets of the brain. Currently the lab is engaged in measurement of the hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, ventricular system, and other brain regional volumes. Each of these techniques have undergone a rigorous validation process. The measurements of brain structures provide a useful means of non-invasively testing for changes in the brain of the patient. Changes over time in the brain can be detected, and evaluated with respect to the treatment that the patient is receiving. 
Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) allows DIAL to obtain an accurate profile of the chemical content of the brain. This sensitive technique can detect small changes in the metabolic state of the brain; changes that vary in response to administration of therapeutic agents. The ability to detect these subtle shifts in brain chemistry allows DIAL to identify changes in the brain with more sensitivity than allowed by image analysis.

For our research we use two model vertebrate systems. A simple vertebrate model that affords us some fundamental advantages in this research is the lamprey central nervous system. The lamprey has a central nervous system that is very simple for a vertebrate and which may be kept alive, isolated but otherwise intact, for a number of days. Additionally, a group of axons in the spinal cord are very large and contain presynaptic structures that are exceptionally accessible to the experimentalist. This combination of features enables us to investigate synaptic plasticity at great detail and to determine its role in motor control. We have focused on the means by which G protein coupled receptors mediate enhancement and inhibition of glutamate release. We have identified a direct target for Gbg on the SNARE complex, the machinery for fusion of synaptic vesicles

More recently we have utilized the rat hippocampus to determine whether similar mechanisms of synaptic plasticity are present in the mammalian brain. We have begun to focus on the role of kinase activation and short-term modification of transmitter release, in addition to how these modifications can alter the formation of memory during induction phases of long-term plasticity.

Yet research on these diseases frequently is limited by the obvious restrictions on studying pathophysiologic processes in the human eye.  Likewise, many human ocular diseases are genetic in origin, but appropriate or available families often are not easy for genetic studies.  Mouse models of inherited ocular disease provide powerful tools for quick genetic analysis and characterization.  The mouse eye is remarkably similar in structure to the human eye, and many developmental or invasive experiments can be done in mice that are impossible in human beings.  Comparative mapping and sequencing between human and mouse genomes shows that knowing the gene location in either man or mouse allows for the same gene to be found more quickly in the other. 

Finally, the use of inbred strains, where all mice in the strain are alike genetically except for the mutation being studied, is a powerful tool for linkage analysis, and assures phenotypic reproducibility of any model found in a strain.  The virutal identity of mice in an inbred strain also allows for fewer numbers of mice to be studied clinically.

Mouse models of retinal degeneration have been investigated for many years in the hope of understanding the causes of photoreceptor cell death. 16 naturally occurring mouse mutants that manifest degeneration of photoreceptors in the retina with preservation of all other retinal cell types have been found: retinal degeneration (formerly rd , identical with rodless retina, r, now Pde6b rd1); Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd); nervous (nr); retinal degeneration slow (rds, now Prph Rd2); retinal degeneration 3 (rd3 ); motor neuron degeneration (mnd); retinal degeneration 4 (Rd4 ); retinal degeneration 5 (rd5); vitiligo (vit , now Mitf mi-vit); retinal degeneration 6 (rd6 ); retinal degeneration 7 (rd7); neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ( nclf ); retinal degeneration 8 (rd8 ); retinal degeneration 9 ( Rd9 ); retinal degeneration 10 (rd10); and cone photoreceptor function loss (cpfl1).

The brain is made of billions of neurons, which together form the world's most powerful information-processing machine. Despite decades of research, the fundamental principle by which these cells work together is still unknown. 
Many theories for brain function have been proposed over the last century. But only in the last few years has it become possible to record simultaneously from large enough numbers of neurons to put these theories to the test experimentally. This is an unprecedented opportunity, but it opens up a new question: how do we go from the gigabytes of experimental data that we now have, to concise conclusions about the function of the brain? 
The data processing methods traditionally used in neuroscience are not sophisticated enough to exploit this new flood of information. Fortunately, modern statistics and machine learning theory is making great strides in precisely the type of techniques needed to process these large multivariate databases. By applying these methods to neuronal data, we can now test long-standing hypotheses about brain function. 
The Cell Assembly 
The main focus of our research is an experimental search for ""cell assemblies"". Before describing what a cell assembly is, it will be useful to describe what it is not. 
The brain is often thought of as a feed-forward system. In this scheme, sensory information is processed by successive levels of cortical analyzers, each of which transforms the results of previous levels, until sensory information is in a suitable form to guide the animals behavior. In support of this idea, the pattern of connections in the cortex does appear to respect a hierarchical organization, with the output of low-level areas corresponding to a single sensory modality being integrated into high-level multi-modal areas. Responses in higher-level sensory areas appear to have more complex responses to sensory stimuli, in agreement with increased abstraction as the hierarchy is traversed. 
However, there are several levels at which this feed-forward picture is incomplete. At the ""circuit diagram"" level, there more connections projecting across and down the hierarchy, than there are feed-forward projections. What's more, if information were processed in a strictly feed-forward manner, one would expect a neuron to respond identically to repeated presentations of the same sensory stimulus. Although this is a fairly good approximation in primary sensory areas of cortex, in high-level structures responses are often more variable than expected from strict sensory control. Finally, although feed-forward processing can describe how an animal could perform simple stimulus-response behaviors, it cannot explain more complex ""top-down"" behaviors such as memory or thought. 
An alternative point of view, put forward over 50 years ago by Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb, holds that recurrent and feedback connections play an essential role in brain function. The principal actor in this view is the cell assembly, an anatomically distributed subset of neurons, amongst which mutually excitatory connections have been strengthened by repeated co-activation, allowing the assembly to later maintain its activity through reverberation without direct sensory stimulation. This theory allows for sensory-response behavior, and also behavior resulting purely from internally generated cognitive activity, by the sequential activation of a series of assemblies, leading in turn to the production of motion. 
In our research, we search for signatures of assembly activity in simultaneous recordings from multiple neurons, and aim to characterize the properties of assembly activity in ways not possible from theory alone.

Software Packages that are currently available for download from the ANSIR Laboratory at Wake Forest University School of Medicine: 
* WFU Biological Parametric Mapping Toolbox: a toolbox for multimodal image analysis that is based on a voxel-wise use of the general linear model. The BPM toolbox incorporates information obtained from other modalities as regressors in a voxel-wise analysis, thereby permitting investigation of more sophisticated hypotheses. The BPM toolbox has been developed in Matlab with a user-friendly interface for performing analyses, including voxel-wise multimodal correlation, ANCOVA, and multiple regression. It has a high degree of integration with the SPM (statistical parametric mapping) software relying on it for visualization and statistical inference. Furthermore, statistical inference for a correlation field, rather than a widely used T-field, has been implemented in the correlation analysis for more accurate results. An example with in vivo data is presented, demonstrating the potential of the BPM methodology as a tool for multimodal image analysis. 

* WFU_PickAtlas: This software provides a method for generating ROI masks based on the Talairach Daemon database. The atlases include Brodmann area, Lobar, Hemisphere, Anatomic Label and Tissue Type. The atlases have been extended to the vertex in MNI space, and corrected for the precentral gyrus anomaly. Additional atlases can be added without much difficulty. 

* WFU_DICOMtk: The WFU_DICOMtk software package converts 3-D image volumes or 2-D images to DICOM format and optionally sends them to a PACS server.  It may also serve as a DICOM image viewer.  The scripts are written entirely in MATLAB.  The images input for DICOM conversion may be either 3-D volumes readable by SPM or any 2-D images supported by MATLAB's imread function.

* WFU_Pipeline: The WFU SPM5 Pipeline is a fully automated method for the processing of fMRI data using SPM. It is fully automated from the point of data acquisition at the MRI scanner. It incorporates tools for automated data transfer, archiving, real-time SPM5 batch script generation with distributed grid processing, automated error-recovery procedures, full data-provenance, email notifications, optional conversion back to DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine), and picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) insertion. The architecture allows for an infinite number of easily definable analyses that are fully automated from the point of acquisition.

* Non-Stationary Cluster Extent Correction for SPM: This toolbox implements the random field theory (RFT) version of cluster size inference under non-stationarity. Non-stationarity, or non-uniform smoothness, is a problem in cluster size inference of brain imaging data. This is because, under non-stationarity, clusters tend to be large in smooth areas and small in rough areas within the image data. Non-stationarity is particularly problematic in VBM (voxel-based morphometry) data, and a use of cluster p-values has been discouraged in analyses of such data. A solution for this non-stationarity problem was proposed by Worsley et al, and has been implemented in the FMRISTAT package. Accounting for non-stationarity is important as it could lead to an erroneous outcome of a VBM analysis, as demonstrated in Moorhead et al. We have ported the function for non-stationary cluster size inference from FMRISTAT to SPM, so that it can interface with the SPM output. 

* Adaptive Staircase Procedure for E-Prime: This package provides the framework for implementing a self-adapting staircase procedure within the E-Prime programming environment. Although staircases have been in use for decades, the few open-source examples currently available require a moderate degree of programming proficiency to integrate into a new experimental procedure. Here, we provide an example developed within the E-Prime that can be easily copied or manipulated for almost any experimental paradigm. It is based on the simple 2-down/1-up method, with adjustable step sizes (if s\desired) and experimenter-definable parameters.

It aims at unraveling the molecular basis for cell death and edema development in stroke, and explores the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and temporal lobe epilepsy. One of the long term goals is to identify new molecular targets for neuroprotective strategies in stroke and other conditions involving glutamate excitotoxicity. 

The main objective of the LMN is to advance our understanding of the role of glutamate, as a transmitter substance in the normal brain and as a mediator of excitotoxicity in pathological conditions such as stroke. To this end the LMN employs several vital and non-vital imaging techniques. Model systems include organotypical slice cultures and transgene animals. 

It is believed that the excitotoxic cascade ultimately leads to DNA damage, partly through excessive formation of oxygen radicals. Thus an important focus of the LMN is to explore the role of DNA damage and repair in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease. 

LMN is also engaged in research on molecular mechanism underlying brain edema, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease. 

Clinical perspective of LMN's activities 
The field of neurology continues to lag behind those of other disciplines when it comes to the range and efficacy of therapeutic strategies. In particular, common neurological conditions such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and other chronic neurodegenerative diseases, age-related cognitive impairment, epilepsy, mood disorders and schizophrenia call for new therapeutic strategies. Several of these conditions are particularly prevalent among the elderly and will constitute a growing health concern as the population ages. Most of the current molecular targets for neurological therapy are found in the monoamine and acetylcholine signaling systems, as use of receptor blockers or other drugs to interfere with the widespread fast signal transmission systems are causing substantial side effects. Future therapies will have to be based on strategies that act by reducing or increasing the number or activity of specific subtypes of pre- and postsynaptic receptors, transporters, and ion channels, or other membrane molecules at the synapse, and by strategies that exploit the new possibilities offered by stem cell technology and targeted repair."

;;Resource:Laboratory of Molecular Neuroscience, University of Oslo;http://neurolex.org/wiki/Category-3AResource-3ALaboratory_of_Molecular_Neuroscience,_University_of_Oslo;"The Laboratory for Molecular Neuroscience investigates molecular mechanisms involved in the development of acute and chronic neurodegenerative disease, with a focus on the role of glutamate excitotoxicity. It aims at unraveling the molecular basis for cell death and edema development in stroke, and explores the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and temporal lobe epilepsy. One of the long term goals is to identify new molecular targets for neuroprotective strategies in stroke and other conditions involving glutamate excitotoxicity. 

The main objective of the LMN is to advance our understanding of the role of glutamate, as a transmitter substance in the normal brain and as a mediator of excitotoxicity in pathological conditions such as stroke. To this end the LMN employs several vital and non-vital imaging techniques. Model systems include organotypical slice cultures and transgene animals. 

It is believed that the excitotoxic cascade ultimately leads to DNA damage, partly through excessive formation of oxygen radicals. Thus an important focus of the LMN is to explore the role of DNA damage and repair in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease. 

LMN is also engaged in research on molecular mechanism underlying brain edema, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease. 

Clinical perspective of LMN's activities 
The field of neurology continues to lag behind those of other disciplines when it comes to the range and efficacy of therapeutic strategies. In particular, common neurological conditions such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and other chronic neurodegenerative diseases, age-related cognitive impairment, epilepsy, mood disorders and schizophrenia call for new therapeutic strategies. Several of these conditions are particularly prevalent among the elderly and will constitute a growing health concern as the population ages. Most of the current molecular targets for neurological therapy are found in the monoamine and acetylcholine signaling systems, as use of receptor blockers or other drugs to interfere with the widespread fast signal transmission systems are causing substantial side effects. Future therapies will have to be based on strategies that act by reducing or increasing the number or activity of specific subtypes of pre- and postsynaptic receptors, transporters, and ion channels, or other membrane molecules at the synapse, and by strategies that exploit the new possibilities offered by stem cell technology and targeted repair."

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) is a private, not-for-profit research and education institution at the forefront of efforts in molecular biology and genetics to generate knowledge that will yield better diagnostics and treatments for cancer, neurological diseases and other major causes of human suffering. 
Home to seven Nobelists, the Laboratory was founded in 1890 as one of the first institutions in the world to specialize in genetics research. CSHL has played a pivotal role in the emergence of molecular genetics, the scientific foundation of the contemporary revolution in biology and biotechnology. At CSHL in 1953, James D. Watson presented his first public lecture on his and Francis Cricks discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA, for which each later won a Nobel Prize. As director and then president of the Laboratory from 1968 to 2003, Watson was instrumental in developing CSHL into one of the worlds most influential cancer research centers. 
Today, CSHL President Bruce Stillman leads more than 400 scientists who are pioneering the frontiers of biomedical research. A designated Center of the U.S. National Cancer Institute, CSHL has broken new ground in the study of cancer-causing genes and signaling pathways implicated in their activation. Key findings on mutations and structural variations of the human genome have been important in this work and in the Laboratorys efforts to understand what causes devastating neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative illnesses such as autism, schizophrenia, and Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases. CSHL is also a global leader in plant genetics and an innovative force in the emerging discipline of quantitative biology.

It also provides a list of known mouse mutations that affect vision and presents updated information on the cloning of vision-related genes. The primary focus is on the mouse as a model of human inherited vision disorders. 

The number of known serious or disabling eye diseases in humans is large and affects millions of people each year.  Yet research on these diseases frequently is limited by the obvious restrictions on studying pathophysiologic processes in the human eye.  Likewise, many human ocular diseases are genetic in origin, but appropriate or available families often are not easy for genetic studies.  Mouse models of inherited ocular disease provide powerful tools for quick genetic analysis and characterization.  The mouse eye is remarkably similar in structure to the human eye, and many developmental or invasive experiments can be done in mice that are impossible in human beings.  Comparative mapping and sequencing between human and mouse genomes shows that knowing the gene location in either man or mouse allows for the same gene to be found more quickly in the other. 

Finally, the use of inbred strains, where all mice in the strain are alike genetically except for the mutation being studied, is a powerful tool for linkage analysis, and assures phenotypic reproducibility of any model found in a strain.  The virutal identity of mice in an inbred strain also allows for fewer numbers of mice to be studied clinically.

In the Laboratory for Visual Neuroscience at the University of California, San Francisco, we are seeking to discover how visual perception occurs in the human brain. The function of the visual system is to guide our behavior by providing an efficient means for the rapid assimilation of information from the environment. As we navigate through our surroundings, a continuous stream of light images impinges on our eyes. In the back of each eye a light-sensitive tissue, the retina, converts patterns of light energy into electrical discharges known as action potentials. These signals are conveyed along the axons of retinal ganglion cells to the lateral geniculate body, a relay nucleus in the thalamus. Most of the output of the lateral geniculate body is relayed directly to the primary visual cortex (striate cortex, V1), and then to surrounding visual association areas. To understand the function of the visual pathways, our research is focused on 5 major themes:
* Organization of Primary Visual Cortex
* Mapping of Extrastriate Visual Cortex
* Amblyopia and Visual Development

Our research is devoted to understanding the changes in vocal behavior that are associated with maturation and social experience under normative conditions, and to investigating neural systems to define their roles in auditory communication. 

The anterior cingulate gyrus, in the frontal cerebral cortex, is an essential neural system for the expression of the primate isolation call, a structural and functional equivalent of the cry sounds of humans. Bilateral removal of this structure in adult squirrel monkeys resulted in a long-lasting inability to emit isolation calls. Partial recovery, often over many weeks, initially took the form of production of short, faint and uninflected versions of the typical isolation call. Humans suffering infarct damage to this region likewise show an initial recovery in the form of short, faint, monosyllabic sounds, suggesting that the anterior cingulate gyrus of nonhuman primates is the evolutionary precursor of a neural structure involved in human affective expression and speech. Our working model of isolation call production is that the anterior cingulate gyrus is the site where the command to produce this vocalization is initiated. Since the anterior cingulate region also has reciprocal connections with temporal lobe auditory cortex, a presumptive feedback pathway exists for registering commands to initiate vocalization with the temporal lobe cortex, which plays a major role in perceiving and decoding the acoustic details of species-specific vocalizations. At present, we do not know the role of the anterior cingulate gyrus in the production of infant vocalizations. However, we have found that neonatal removal of the amygdala, an important forebrain component of the limbic system, or portions of the inferotemporal gyrus, which sends projections to the amygdala, result in significant changes in the vocal behavior of infant rhesus macaques.

Vocal development is a dynamic process, and a pattern shared by several nonhuman primates has emerged regarding the nature of this process. Infants are highly vocal during periods of brief separation from their caregiver, and we take advantage of this to document the range of vocalizations produced by infants of different ages. In the neonatal period, infants of 3 species of nonhuman primate (rhesus macaque, squirrel monkey and common marmoset) all produce sounds that vary widely in their acoustic structure. Many of these bear a striking similarity to sounds used in a variety of social settings by adults, suggesting that neural systems responsible for generating adult vocalizations are already in place during early infancy. As infants mature, their vocal behavior during brief periods of social separation becomes much more stereotyped. It isn't until much later in development, as individuals engage in a variety of social interactions with peers and adults, that the sounds expressed in early infancy begin to re-appear in adult contexts. The role of individual experience during development is currently being explored to determine the mechanisms leading to the acquisition of adult vocal skills."

MMIL houses an interdisciplinary group of scientists and clinicians who study the human brain using a variety of imaging/recording/computational techniques. The primary goal is to bridge non-invasive imaging technologies to the underlying neurophysiology of brain neuronal circuits for better understanding of healthy human brain function, and mechanisms of disruption of this function in diseases such as Alzheimers, epilepsy and stroke. 

The purposes of MMIL are to develop and apply advanced imaging techniques to understanding the human brain and its disorders. Noninvasive methodologies include structural MRI, DTI, fMRI, PET, MEG, and EEG. In order to ground these methodological developments in their underlying neurobiology, invasive studies in humans and animals involving optical and microphysiological measures are also performed. These methodologies are applied to understanding normal function in sleep, memory and language, development and aging, and diseases such as dementia, epilepsy and autism.

Our research is devoted to understanding the changes in vocal behavior that are associated with maturation and social experience under normative conditions, and to investigating neural systems to define their roles in auditory communication. 

The anterior cingulate gyrus, in the frontal cerebral cortex, is an essential neural system for the expression of the primate isolation call, a structural and functional equivalent of the cry sounds of humans. Bilateral removal of this structure in adult squirrel monkeys resulted in a long-lasting inability to emit isolation calls. Partial recovery, often over many weeks, initially took the form of production of short, faint and uninflected versions of the typical isolation call. Humans suffering infarct damage to this region likewise show an initial recovery in the form of short, faint, monosyllabic sounds, suggesting that the anterior cingulate gyrus of nonhuman primates is the evolutionary precursor of a neural structure involved in human affective expression and speech. Our working model of isolation call production is that the anterior cingulate gyrus is the site where the command to produce this vocalization is initiated. Since the anterior cingulate region also has reciprocal connections with temporal lobe auditory cortex, a presumptive feedback pathway exists for registering commands to initiate vocalization with the temporal lobe cortex, which plays a major role in perceiving and decoding the acoustic details of species-specific vocalizations. At present, we do not know the role of the anterior cingulate gyrus in the production of infant vocalizations. However, we have found that neonatal removal of the amygdala, an important forebrain component of the limbic system, or portions of the inferotemporal gyrus, which sends projections to the amygdala, result in significant changes in the vocal behavior of infant rhesus macaques.

Vocal development is a dynamic process, and a pattern shared by several nonhuman primates has emerged regarding the nature of this process. Infants are highly vocal during periods of brief separation from their caregiver, and we take advantage of this to document the range of vocalizations produced by infants of different ages. In the neonatal period, infants of 3 species of nonhuman primate (rhesus macaque, squirrel monkey and common marmoset) all produce sounds that vary widely in their acoustic structure. Many of these bear a striking similarity to sounds used in a variety of social settings by adults, suggesting that neural systems responsible for generating adult vocalizations are already in place during early infancy. As infants mature, their vocal behavior during brief periods of social separation becomes much more stereotyped. It isn't until much later in development, as individuals engage in a variety of social interactions with peers and adults, that the sounds expressed in early infancy begin to re-appear in adult contexts. The role of individual experience during development is currently being explored to determine the mechanisms leading to the acquisition of adult vocal skills."

It incorporates tools for automated data transfer, archiving, real-time SPM5 batch script generation with distributed grid processing, automated error-recovery procedures, full data-provenance, email notifications, optional conversion back to DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine), and picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) insertion. The architecture allows for an infinite number of easily definable analyses that are fully automated from the point of acquisition.

* Non-Stationary Cluster Extent Correction for SPM: This toolbox implements the random field theory (RFT) version of cluster size inference under non-stationarity. Non-stationarity, or non-uniform smoothness, is a problem in cluster size inference of brain imaging data. This is because, under non-stationarity, clusters tend to be large in smooth areas and small in rough areas within the image data. Non-stationarity is particularly problematic in VBM (voxel-based morphometry) data, and a use of cluster p-values has been discouraged in analyses of such data. A solution for this non-stationarity problem was proposed by Worsley et al, and has been implemented in the FMRISTAT package. Accounting for non-stationarity is important as it could lead to an erroneous outcome of a VBM analysis, as demonstrated in Moorhead et al. We have ported the function for non-stationary cluster size inference from FMRISTAT to SPM, so that it can interface with the SPM output. 

* Adaptive Staircase Procedure for E-Prime: This package provides the framework for implementing a self-adapting staircase procedure within the E-Prime programming environment. Although staircases have been in use for decades, the few open-source examples currently available require a moderate degree of programming proficiency to integrate into a new experimental procedure. Here, we provide an example developed within the E-Prime that can be easily copied or manipulated for almost any experimental paradigm. It is based on the simple 2-down/1-up method, with adjustable step sizes (if s\desired) and experimenter-definable parameters.

Software Packages that are currently available for download from the ANSIR Laboratory at Wake Forest University School of Medicine: 
* WFU Biological Parametric Mapping Toolbox: a toolbox for multimodal image analysis that is based on a voxel-wise use of the general linear model. The BPM toolbox incorporates information obtained from other modalities as regressors in a voxel-wise analysis, thereby permitting investigation of more sophisticated hypotheses. The BPM toolbox has been developed in Matlab with a user-friendly interface for performing analyses, including voxel-wise multimodal correlation, ANCOVA, and multiple regression. It has a high degree of integration with the SPM (statistical parametric mapping) software relying on it for visualization and statistical inference. Furthermore, statistical inference for a correlation field, rather than a widely used T-field, has been implemented in the correlation analysis for more accurate results. An example with in vivo data is presented, demonstrating the potential of the BPM methodology as a tool for multimodal image analysis. 

* WFU_PickAtlas: This software provides a method for generating ROI masks based on the Talairach Daemon database. The atlases include Brodmann area, Lobar, Hemisphere, Anatomic Label and Tissue Type. The atlases have been extended to the vertex in MNI space, and corrected for the precentral gyrus anomaly. Additional atlases can be added without much difficulty. 

* WFU_DICOMtk: The WFU_DICOMtk software package converts 3-D image volumes or 2-D images to DICOM format and optionally sends them to a PACS server.  It may also serve as a DICOM image viewer.

In its present version CASP does not control a video or CCD camera. Comets stained with silver (dark cells on white background) must be converted into negative images in order to be analysed correctly. An unlimited number of images can be marked, CASP will load them successively into a ""image view"" window (see screenshot). Only comets oriented from left (head) to right (tail) can be analysed correctly. The user can adjust various thresholds of sensitivity and save the adjustments for future use. A measurement frame is drawn on the screen and its size adjusted. The adjustments are frozen to prevent accidental modification. The frame is moved onto a cell and measurement is activated. An intensity profile shows up on a ""profile"" window together with selected result values (right window on figure 1) and the result can be saved.
In addition to such parameter as head radius, tail length etc, the program calculates the tail moment (TM) and the Olive tail moment (OTM). If several cells are present on the same picture, the user can proceed with the measurement of another cell on the same picture or can load a new picture. The saved results can be visualized during the working session in a spreadsheet in ""view results"" window. When measurements are terminated, the results can be exported into a text file and imported into a commercial spreadsheet calculation program. CASP is optimized for a 600x800 resolution.

Various Images, Videos and Talks related to the research are available.

In the Laboratory for Visual Neuroscience at the University of California, San Francisco, we are seeking to discover how visual perception occurs in the human brain. The function of the visual system is to guide our behavior by providing an efficient means for the rapid assimilation of information from the environment. As we navigate through our surroundings, a continuous stream of light images impinges on our eyes. In the back of each eye a light-sensitive tissue, the retina, converts patterns of light energy into electrical discharges known as action potentials. These signals are conveyed along the axons of retinal ganglion cells to the lateral geniculate body, a relay nucleus in the thalamus. Most of the output of the lateral geniculate body is relayed directly to the primary visual cortex (striate cortex, V1), and then to surrounding visual association areas. To understand the function of the visual pathways, our research is focused on 5 major themes:
* Organization of Primary Visual Cortex
* Mapping of Extrastriate Visual Cortex
* Amblyopia and Visual Development

A major task is to find the neuronal codes of internal representations of memory items and the mapping rules between the levels of gene expression/proteins synthesis and the level of cognitive processing. Novel combinations of approaches, including multiple single-cell recording technology, patch-clamp electrophysiology, neuroanatomy/neurochemistry at the cellular and subcellular levels, and computational models are employed to test specific hypotheses about that mapping process (such as local circuit anatomy and activity-dependent short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity). Collaborations within the Institute allows the group to also incorporate gene targeting methods and behavioral learning/memory tests in their methodological repertoire. 
The laboratory has been focusing on the normal and pathological (epileptic, ischemic) activity of cortical networks, with particular attention to the generation of behaviour-dependent population discharge patterns (theta and gamma oscillations, hippocampal sharp waves). Anatomical, in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological, pharmacological and molecular techniques and modeling are combined to elucidate the functional roles of inhibitory cell types in the control of population synchrony and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, their local and subcortical modulation via selective afferent pathways (GABAergic and cholinergic septal, as well as serotonergic raphe input) and pre- or postsynaptic receptors. An expanding new direction of research is related to the role of endocannabinoid signaling in the activity-dependent modulation of GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission, and its involvement in anxiety-like behavior."

The Institute and CVRL are both closely associated with Moorfields Eye Hospital. The Institute is next door to Moorfields Eye Hospital near Old Street tube station (see directions). 
At the Colour & Vision Research laboratory, we investigate normal and clinical human visual perception. Our research focuses on questions about colour perception, light and dark adaptation, night-time vision, and the temporal and spatial properties of vision. Our primary goal is to understand the nature of the mechanisms that underlie visual perception, and to understand how those mechanism malfunction in clinical cases. More details about our research can be found by looking at the publications of members of the laboratory. 
The CVRL database, first set up in 1995, provides an annotated library of downloadable standard data sets relevant to colour and vision research. The focus of this site is primarily scientific and technical, but some introductory background information is also provided. A consistent set of functions for modeling colour vision based on the Stockman & Sharpe cone fundamentals and on our more recent luminous efficiency measurements are summarized under the category CVRL functions. These functions are tabulated in 0.1, 1 and 5 nm steps and can be returned as csv, xml, or tabular data or as dynamic plots. 
The Stockman & Sharpe cone fundamentals are the basis of a CIE proposal for physiologically-relevant colour matching functions. These functions, which are indentical to the CVRL functions, are summarized under the category CIE 2007 functions. The CIE functions are also tabulated in 0.1, 1 and 5 nm steps, and can also be returned as csv, xml, or tabular data or as dynamic plots. 
Significant additions to the database are the individual colour matching measurements made by Stiles & Burch. These have been compiled and cross-checked with the help of Boris Oicherman, Alexander Logvinenko, and Abhijit Sarkar from hard copies of the original data provided by Pat Trezona and Mike Webster. They can be obtained as Excel files and are available for both 2 and 10 colour matches. Other data sets, which are provided as csv files, include cone fundamentals, colour matching functions, chromaticity coordinates, prereceptoral filter density spectra, photopigment spectra, and CIE standards.

MMIL houses an interdisciplinary group of scientists and clinicians who study the human brain using a variety of imaging/recording/computational techniques. The primary goal is to bridge non-invasive imaging technologies to the underlying neurophysiology of brain neuronal circuits for better understanding of healthy human brain function, and mechanisms of disruption of this function in diseases such as Alzheimers, epilepsy and stroke. 

The purposes of MMIL are to develop and apply advanced imaging techniques to understanding the human brain and its disorders. Noninvasive methodologies include structural MRI, DTI, fMRI, PET, MEG, and EEG. In order to ground these methodological developments in their underlying neurobiology, invasive studies in humans and animals involving optical and microphysiological measures are also performed. These methodologies are applied to understanding normal function in sleep, memory and language, development and aging, and diseases such as dementia, epilepsy and autism. 
Sponsors: MMIL investigators are PIs on 16+ currently funded grants (9 from NIH), and co-investigators on many more grants with PIs from many departments at UCSD and multiple institutions."
