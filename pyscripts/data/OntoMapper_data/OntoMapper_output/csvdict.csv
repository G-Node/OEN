;;Resource:Fast Light Toolkit;http://neurolex.org/wiki/Nif-2D0000-2D30565;" 
This document defines the processes and standards that all FLTK developers must follow when developing and documenting FLTK, and how trouble reports are handled and releases are generated. The purpose of defining formal processes and standards is to organize and focus our development efforts, ensure that all developers communicate and develop software with a common vocabulary/style, and make it possible for us to generate and release a high-quality GUI toolkit which can be used with a high degree of confidence. 
Much of this file describes the existing practices that have been used up through FLTK 1.1.x, however I have also added some new processes/standards to use for future code and releases. 
The fltk-dev mailing list and fltk.development newsgroup are the primary means of communication between developers. All major design changes must be discussed prior to implementation. 
Specific Goals 
The specific goals of the FLTK are as follows: 
Develop a C++ GUI toolkit based upon sound object-oriented design principles and experience. (*) 
Minimize CPU usage (fast). (*) 
Minimize memory usage (light). (*) 
Support multiple operating systems and windowing environments, including UNIX/Linux, MacOS X, Microsoft Windows, and X11, using the ""native"" graphics interfaces. (*) 
Support OpenGL rendering in environments that provide it. (*) 
Provide a graphical development environment for designing GUI interfaces, classes, and simple programs. (*) 
Support UTF-8 text. 
Support printer rendering in environments that provide it. 
Support ""schemes"", ""styles"", ""themes"", ""skinning"", etc. to alter the appearance of widgets in the toolkit easily and efficiently. The purpose is to allow applications to tailor their appearance to the underlying OS or based upon personal/user preferences. 
Support newer C++ language features, such as templating via the Standard Template Library (""STL""), and certain Standard C++ library interfaces, such as streams. However, FLTK will not depend upon such features and interfaces to minimize portability issues. 
Support intelligent layout of widgets. 
Many of these goals are satisfied by FLTK 1.1.x (*), and many complex applications have been written using FLTK on a wide range of platforms and devices. Development of the remaining features is proceding for FLTK 2.0 with a new, namespace-based API. While 2.0 offers some limited 1.x source compatibility, the changes to the underlying widget classes are significant enough to prevent full compatibility. 
Software Development Practices 
Documentation 
All widgets are documented using the Doxygen software; Doxygen comments are placed in the header file for the class comments and any inline methods, while non-inline methods should have their comments placed in the corresponding source file. The purpose of this separation is to place the comments near the implementation to reduce the possibility of the documentation getting out of sync with the code. 
All widgets must have a corresponding test program which exercises all widget functionality and can be used to generate image(s) for the documentation. Complex widgets must have a written tutorial, either as full text or an outline for later publication 
The final manuals are formatted using the HTMLDOC software.

;;Resource:Blind Source Separation and Independent Component Analysis;http://neurolex.org/wiki/Category-3AResource-3ABlind_Source_Separation_and_Independent_Component_Analysis;"Blind Source Separation and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithms including: An efficient batch algorithm: JADE and Adaptive algorithms: relative gradient algorithms. Associated papers / documentation are included as well as thoughts on Multi-dimensional independent component analysis. 

* An efficient batch algorithm: JADE - For off-line ICA, an algorithm has been developed based on the (joint) diagonalization of cumulant matrices. `Good' statistical performance is achieved by involving all the cumulants of order 2 and 4 while a fast optimization is obtained by the device of joint diagonalization. JADE has been successfully applied to the processing of real data sets, such as found in mobile telephony and in airport radar as well as to bio-medical signals (ECG, EEG, multi-electrode neural recordings). The strongest point of JADE for applications of ICA is that it works off-the-shelf (no parameter tuning). They advocate using the code provided as a plug-in replacement for PCA (whenever one is willing to investigate if such a replacement is appropriate). The weakest point of the current implementation is that the number of sources (but not of sensors) is limited in practice (by the available memory) to something like 40 or 50 depending on your computer. The JADE algorithm was originally developed to process complex signals, motivated by applications to digital communications. Another implementation is now available which is tuned to process more efficiently real-valued signals. 
* Adaptive algorithms: relative gradient algorithms - For adaptive source separation, they have developed a class of equivariant algorithms. This means that their performance is independent of the mixing matrix. They are obtained as stochastic relative gradient algorithms. 
* Multi-dimensional independent component analysis - Performing ICA on ECG signals with the JADE algorithm, it was realized that an interesting extension of the notion of independent component analysis would be to consider an analysis into linear components that would be 'as independent as possible' as in ICA, but would be `living' in subspaces of dimension greater than 1. This could be called `MICA' for Multi-dimensional Independent Component Analysis."

This is an open-source Mouse Exonic Evidence-Based Oligonucleotide Chip (MEEBOChip), and are in the process of building the human counterpart, HEEBOChip. The set of 70mers for MEEBOChip is already available from Illumina, Inc., with synthesis of HEEBOChip 70mers in progress. 
Both arrays are based on a novel selection of exonic  long-oligonucleotides (70-mers) from a genomic annotation of the corresponding complete genome sequences, using a transcriptome-based annotation of exon structure for each genomic locus. Using a combination of existing and custom-tailored tools and datasets  (including millions of mRNA and EST sequences), we built and performed a systematic examination of transcript-supported exon structure for each genomic locus at the base-pair level (i.e., exonic evidence). This strategy allowed them to select both constitutive and in many cases alternative exons for nearly every gene in the corresponding genome (e.g., protocadherin locus), allowing an unprecedented exploration of human and mouse biology. 
Furthermore, they used experimentally derived data to hone the selection of these 70mers, helping maximize their performance under typical fluorescent labeling and hybridization conditions. Specifically, they applied and refined the ArrayOligoSelector algorithm from Joe DeRisis laboratory to select 70mers, considering not only their uniqueness (i.e., hybridization specificity) within the content of the entire genome, but also to overcome the known biases of labeling and hybridization methods (e.g., 3-biased reverse transcription and in vitro transcription reactions).

And soon the human counterpart, HEEBOChip, will also be available. The set of 70mers for MEEBOChip is already available from Illumina, Inc., with synthesis of HEEBOChip 70mers in progress.
Both arrays are based on a novel selection of exonic long-oligonucleotides (70-mers) from a genomic annotation of the corresponding complete genome sequences, using a transcriptome-based annotation of exon structure for each genomic locus. Using a combination of existing and custom-tailored tools and datasets (including millions of mRNA and EST sequences), we built and performed a systematic examination of transcript-supported exon structure for each genomic locus at the base-pair level (i.e., exonic evidence). This strategy allowed them to select both constitutive and in many cases alternative exons for nearly every gene in the corresponding genome (e.g., protocadherin locus), allowing an unprecedented exploration of human and mouse biology.
Furthermore, they used experimentally derived data to hone the selection of these 70mers, helping maximize their performance under typical fluorescent labeling and hybridization conditions. Specifically, they applied and refined the ArrayOligoSelector algorithm from Joe DeRisi's laboratory to select 70mers, considering not only their uniqueness (i.e., hybridization specificity) within the content of the entire genome, but also to overcome the known biases of labeling and hybridization methods (e.g., 3'-biased reverse transcription and in vitro transcription reactions).

The OSSP hopes to transform how academic research is funded and increase the accessibility of academic research.
* Researchers pay a monthly subscription to create and maintain public profiles
* Researchers alone (or in teams) submit proposed research studies - each study is peer reviewed, and (if approved) is then posted online
*  Investors browse through posted studies, and invest in them via small grants (microinvestments). The OSSP doesn't charge any transaction fees or commissions
* Researchers whose studies are funded conduct their research and publish their results
It is in the best interest of each researcher to ""make their case"" to as many citizens as possible to ensure that they are aware of the work the researcher is engaged in - and of its importance. It is to help academic researchers make this case, and invite the broader non-research community to play a more active role in the academic research process, that The OSSP has developed this unique platform.

Through the tools and resources offered by The OSSP, academic researchers may:
* Create publicly-accessible profiles
* Interact and exchange ideas with peers and colleagues
* Manage scholarly publications/bibliographies
* Secure research funding (in the form of microgrants provided by the broader non-research community)

;;Resource:Blind Source Separation and Independent Component Analysis;http://neurolex.org/wiki/Nif-2D0000-2D24771;"Blind Source Separation and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithms including: An efficient batch algorithm: JADE and Adaptive algorithms: relative gradient algorithms. Associated papers / documentation are included as well as thoughts on Multi-dimensional independent component analysis. 

* An efficient batch algorithm: JADE - For off-line ICA, an algorithm has been developed based on the (joint) diagonalization of cumulant matrices. `Good' statistical performance is achieved by involving all the cumulants of order 2 and 4 while a fast optimization is obtained by the device of joint diagonalization. JADE has been successfully applied to the processing of real data sets, such as found in mobile telephony and in airport radar as well as to bio-medical signals (ECG, EEG, multi-electrode neural recordings). The strongest point of JADE for applications of ICA is that it works off-the-shelf (no parameter tuning). They advocate using the code provided as a plug-in replacement for PCA (whenever one is willing to investigate if such a replacement is appropriate). The weakest point of the current implementation is that the number of sources (but not of sensors) is limited in practice (by the available memory) to something like 40 or 50 depending on your computer. The JADE algorithm was originally developed to process complex signals, motivated by applications to digital communications. Another implementation is now available which is tuned to process more efficiently real-valued signals. 
* Adaptive algorithms: relative gradient algorithms - For adaptive source separation, they have developed a class of equivariant algorithms. This means that their performance is independent of the mixing matrix. They are obtained as stochastic relative gradient algorithms. 
* Multi-dimensional independent component analysis - Performing ICA on ECG signals with the JADE algorithm, it was realized that an interesting extension of the notion of independent component analysis would be to consider an analysis into linear components that would be 'as independent as possible' as in ICA, but would be `living' in subspaces of dimension greater than 1. This could be called `MICA' for Multi-dimensional Independent Component Analysis."

Running Python and MATLAB in a single interpreter avoids issues with running two separate applications. Python adds general purpose programming libraries to the convenient syntax of the language of technical computing.
OMPC is not an interpreter, it lets Python to do the work. This means that if Python gets faster OMPC gets faster too. OMPC translates the m-files preserving the structure of the original programs as much as possible. Although OMPC comes with a library that emulates the features of numerical array of MATLAB there is nothing that will stop you from running the translated code the way you like it. This means that you could run the OMPC generated code on IronPython, Jython, PyPy or whatever else if you write your own numerical class.
